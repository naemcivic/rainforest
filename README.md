This Web Application is a basic clone of online listing services like
Amazon, where users can sign-up to view listings, pose item Listings for sale
and leave a review for an item.

The primary features of Ruby on Rails to build this web app is:

    * Using 3 different models which are associated.
    * Using different controllers for corresponding actions
    * Validations of user input
    * Authentication via Bcrypt
    * Basic Authorizations
    * Filters and helper methods
    * Partial Forms deployed to help make code less chunky to be
      more managable.


    Things I would like to learn more of are Filters and Helper Methods.
